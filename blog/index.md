*Medium, May 2021*<br>
I’ve had plenty of ups and downs in the last 12 months. On the plus side, I feel I’ve learned more about my mental health. And I’ve discovered something that helps — a joyfully deliberate day off. 

**[I rebuilt my website the hard way – again](/blog/i-rebuilt-my-website-the-hard-way-again/)** · *Sep 2020*<br> Having rebuilt my website the hard way last year, I decided to rebuild my website the hard way, again...
