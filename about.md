> Curiosity, positivity, kindness, and a 'start with why' approach! Also some dope designs.

– *360 feedback from a colleague, May 2020*

I'm an in-house lead product designer and manager at [Farewill](https://farewill.com/). As a designer I try to join the dots between problems and outcomes, openly and collaboratively. As a manager, I love helping others to be the best they can be.

As well as my [user manual (below)](#user-manual), you might like to read my DiSC profile (coming soon!), find out [what's included with me](/what-is-included), or read about my [Myers Briggs personality](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality).

## <a name="user-manual"></a>My user manual

It can be hard to get to know colleagues, but it's important because it helps us work together better and feel more comfortable and engaged. I'm hoping this user manual (aka a [manual of me](https://manualofme.co/)) will help my colleagues get to know me.

I've been inspired to write one by the likes of [Dan](https://medium.com/@dasbarrett/a-user-manual-for-dan-d0a285874f72), [Cassie](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) and [Richard](https://medium.com/@mcleanonline/helping-other-people-get-to-know-you-aa2dbff5c0f8). 

#### Conditions I like to work in
* A mix of office and home ~~- currently it's 2 days office, 3 days home, which works well~~ 
* A clean, tidy environment
* Regular, short breaks - a wander with a coffee helps me clear my mind
* Being around kind, friendly, thoughtful, interesting people
* I like to be positive - I'm told I'm always smiling at work! But if I'm not feeling great I'll be honest about it.

#### The times / hours I like to work

* Usually I start and finish bang on time
* But I like a degree of flexibility - I'll sometimes pop out for a haircut or finish a few minutes early for dinner
* I'm not at my best before 10am or after 5pm - I prefer to avoid meetings during these times
* I never read or respond to messages when I'm not working (and I dislike it when others do)

#### The best ways to communicate with me
* As a remote worker, the main thing is simply that we _do_ communicate, so I like to make it as easy as possible
* Slack is usually best for anything short and sweet
* In person or webcam is better for anything longer or in need of explanation
* I'm happy to have impromptu conversations - interrupt me any time
* I don't like rambling chats - in a work context, I prefer keeping things to the point (that said, I'm happy to be a sounding board)
* I like agreeing outcomes and actions

#### The ways I like to receive feedback
* Regularly, openly and honestly - I firmly believe the more a team normalises regular, open feedback the better
* I value negative and positive feedback equally
* Please don't wait to be asked - give me feedback whenever you have it, I value it greatly

#### Things I need
* Purpose and meaningful problems to solve
* Trust and responsibility
* Collaboration - I’m a firm believer that we get better outcomes by bringing others along on the journey
* Frankness, openness and honest criticism
* Kindness, praise and encouragement
* Goals
* Focused, purposeful meetings

#### Things I struggle with
* People who aren't culturally aligned with me - I find it tiring and I get defensive (which is something I dislike about myself)
* Loud voices and dictators
* People who don't value understanding the problem, defining needs or doing research
* Gossip and politics

#### Things I love
* Leading, managing and hiring - it's wonderful helping others be their best selves at work
* Input from others in the design process - I'm not egotistical or precious and I see my role as getting the best outcomes, which means it doesn't have to be me coming up with all the ideas
* Working as part of a multi-talented, creative, engaged team 
* Empathetic, emotionally-intelligent people who put customers first
* Learning and new experiences

#### Other things to know about me
* Work-life balance is vital - I've read too many tales from regretful, work-obsessed old people. I'm at my most productive when everything's in balance
* I suffer from imposter syndrome which I use as motivation to learn
* I prefer solving user problems than selling stuff
* I'm happiest when I [bring my whole self to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2WKQWG_Dg) - i.e. I can be myself
* I think I'm on the border between extrovert and introvert

> I’m frequently in awe at how Tom can take in what seems to be something incredibly complex or vague and loosely defined and produce out the other side a really clear and well understood model, diagram, design or kick-off document
