  - title: Conditions I like to work in
    content: In a team, collaborating. I need to be free to bring my whole self to work – I can't and won't put on a show. I've worked mainly remotely for many years and have a great home office setup. It suits me, but I need a mix – perhaps a day or two in the office each week, pandemics permitting. I like to be positive I'm told I'm always smiling at work – although I'm sure that's not true, and it's helpful to me to be honest if I'm feeling down. 
  - title: How I like to receive feedback
    content: Regularly, openly and honestly – the more we can normalise this the better. I'm hugely grateful to anyone who helps me improve through feedback (I find the [COIN framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/COIN.htm) helps).
  - title: The times and hours I like to work
    content: I'm not at my best before 10am or after 5pm – I prefer to avoid meetings during these times. I keep regular hours and very rarely work past 6pm, when I eat dinner with my family. I never send or read work messages out of hours, and I discourage others who do. There's nothing more important to my happiness and productivity than a good work-life balance.
  - title: How to communicate with me
    content: Ideally, politely – I'm a sucker for a 'how are you?', a please and a thanks. But I'm respectful of other peoples' communication styles, so please be yourself. I don't like Slack for anything other than simple, short messages – for anything complicated or at risk of being misconstrued, I much prefer to chat in person. If I'm stressed or feeling defensive, I try to have a good night's sleep before responding. 
  - title: Things I struggle with
    content: Swoops and poops. Loudness. People who don't listen actively. Egos. 
  - title: Things I love
    content: Other teammates contributing to the design process – it's all about outcomes, not egos. Being part of a creative, engaged team. Learning. New experiences. Dad jokes. Puns.

I'm an in-house lead product designer at fast-growing Series B startup [Farewill](https://farewill.com/). I like to join the dots between complex problems and outcomes in a kind, open and deeply collaborative way. 

As a manager and senior member of the design team I try to listen, support and help others be the best they can be.

## <a name="user-manual"></a>User manual

I've been inspired to write a user manual (aka a [manual of me](https://manualofme.co/)) by the likes of [Dan](https://medium.com/@dasbarrett/a-user-manual-for-dan-d0a285874f72), [Cassie](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) and [Richard](https://medium.com/@mcleanonline/helping-other-people-get-to-know-you-aa2dbff5c0f8). I hope by being open I'll help others empathise with me, so we can work together better.

> I’m frequently in awe at how Tom can take in what seems to be something incredibly complex or vague and loosely defined and produce out the other side a really clear and well understood model, diagram, design or kick-off document
