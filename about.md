Before becoming a professional illustrator, I was a museum professional. I worked with collections across the north of England, including Sheffield Galleries & Museums Trust, York Museums Trust and Hull Museums. I also spent two years as the Editor of Young Archaeologist Magazine.

I enjoy making illustrations that are not only lively and engaging but also historically accurate.

I've worked with galleries, museums and heritage sites all over the UK, including the Museum of London, the National Maritime Museum and York Museums Trust. 

My illustrations are used in a variety of ways, including:

* Family trails
* Exhibition captions for children
* Illustrated maps
* Educational resources
* Activity sheets
* Marketing materials
* Animated videos
* Merchandise
* Life sized character cut outs!
