I need to know the why, so I love working with researchers and doing research myself. 

I always work collaboratively. I love being part of a cross-functional product team.

I like to lead projects and bring others along on the journey. 

Time and effort upfront almost always leads to better outcomes. But I avoid process for the sake of it – I like to work purposefully.

I need to be making an impact on important problems. That's why at the moment I'm enjoying working in death and bereavement.

As much as design, I enjoy management. To me, that means helping others achieve great outcomes. For creative, high performing people, management is mainly about support, and creating and environment to work with autonomy, mastery and purpose.

Besides management, I try and be a good leader. Often, that's about listening actively and caring genuinely.

I never do anything perfectly. I enjoy learning and levelling up, and helping those around me level up too.

I keep a strict work-life balance so I can be with my family, pursue my hobbies and find creative ways to waste time. 

I live in York.
