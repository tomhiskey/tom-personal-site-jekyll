As a product designer, I try to join the dots between problems and outcomes, openly and collaboratively. As a manager, I do my best to support others and help them achieve great outcomes.

I'm super invested in needs and problems. I prefer to be involved from the start – doing primary research or working with researchers and PMs. I love leading on projects and running a collaborative, open process where we're reaching great outcomes, together. I'm at my happiest working on meaningful problems as part of an in-house cross-functional product team.

As much as design, I enjoy management. To me, that means helping others achieve great outcomes and creating an environment for people to work with autonomy, mastery and purpose.

#### This is me...

#### Not so much...
E-commerce · marketing · sales · branding · native apps · haptics · some aspects of visual design · typography · illustration · coding (mostly)
