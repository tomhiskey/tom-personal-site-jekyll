I’ve spent 10 years researching, designing and launching impactful digital products. And for the last few years, managing design and research teams too.

I've most recently worked at [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/), [Thriva](https://thriva.co/) and [Farewill](https://farewill.com/), in London. For more about these and other roles, [see LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-hiskey-79390822/). 

Feel free to take a look at [my case studies](/portfolio/) and [blog posts](/blog/).

And [here's my user manual](/user-manual/), to help get to know me better.

I live in York (UK). My pronouns are he/him.
