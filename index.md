<div class="post-subtitle" markdown="1"></div>

Over the past 10 years I’ve worked in the Health & Safety, Legal and Healthtech sectors, for EcoOnline, Thriva, Farewill and others. 

I’ve delivered successful digital products across web and mobile for enterprise B2B SaaS and scaling B2C startups.

I’m an end-to-end product designer and researcher, relishing everything from deep problem discovery to crafting delightful, accessible UI – always cross-functionally. 

I work with peers on planning and strategy. I’ve been a line manager and I’ve led high performing design and research teams.
