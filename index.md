title: Hello there! I'm Tom, a product design manager
hide_title: false
subtitle: I care about supporting people, elevating teams, designing human-centered products and shaping strategy.

  - title: Conditions I like to work in
    content: In a team, collaborating with thoughtful, supportive, talented people. I like working remotely, but also get a buzz from the office environment and in-person chats. I like to be positive I've been told I'm always smiling at work – although I'm sure that's not true, and it's helpful to me to be honest if I'm feeling down. 
  - title: How I like to receive feedback
    content: Regularly, openly and honestly please! The more we can normalise this the better. I find the [COIN framework](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/COIN.htm) helpful.
  - title: The times and hours I like to work
    content: I work from 9am to 6pm when I have dinner with my family. All work devices etc are off beyond these times. I encourage others to do the same and I think leadership has an example to set, to help people achieve a good work-life balance and not burn out.
  - title: How to communicate with me
    content: Most of all, please be yourself – we all have different communication styles. But I'm also a sucker for a polite 'how are you?', please, thank you and light-hearted emojis. Slack's fine for simple, short messages, but for anything deeper or complicated I might suggest we have a proper chat. I may prefer to have a night's sleep before responding to something tricky. 
  - title: Things I struggle with
    content: My imposter syndrome, which often makes me think that everyone else knows better. I can get defensive during disagreements (did you know that's [hard-wired into our human brains?](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/conflicted-is-there-a-route-to-better-disagreement-at-work/id1190000968?i=1000507995326)), but less so than I used to.
  - title: Things I love
    content: Awkward silences (my colleague Helena calls me the king of awkward silences) – I think they're such a helpful way to get other people to speak, particularly quieter members of a group. I also love other teammates contributing to the design process, whatever their role. And dad jokes.
  - title: Myers-Briggs personality
    content: I'm [ENFJ - a protagonist](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality), although I reckon I'm on the border of extrovert and introvert (and Myers-Briggs is unreliable at best...)

Aka a [manual of me](https://manualofme.co/), to help teammates understand me a little better.
