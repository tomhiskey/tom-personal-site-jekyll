## Problem
Farewill’s probate service was scaling rapidly. We needed to help our team manage cases and workflows while maintaining great customer service. Our makeshift 3rd party tools were creaking. 
How can we build internal tools to help us understand:

– What happens next in a case?

– What happens next for one of our team members?

## Project
We called this our ‘What happens next?’ project. It lasted about 4 months. It was a big project. Essentially, building a case management system from scratch.
At Farewill, we build internal tools with as much care as our customer-facing product.
We measured the success of the project through quantitative operational efficiency improvements and qualitative benchmarking surveys. 

## Team
Me – sole product designer and project lead, working as part of an in-house cross-functional product team including:

User researcher (Clare), PMs (James and Emma), engineers (Emily, Jacob, Gavin, Sarah, Kat), plus various users and stakeholders. 

## Process
Our researcher Clare conducted some wonderfully helpful research, observing users with the existing tools and mapping out user flows.

I continued the research with further observation sessions.

I ran a kick-off workshop. I asked our illustrator Louis to draw a mountain for an interactive element of the session. When I run kick-offs, I like to start wide and have as many people involved as possible. I try to give everyone a chance to contribute, if they want to. A good kick-off surfaces key issues, sets up the next steps and brings people along on the journey.

I wrote a kick-off doc.

I ran various workshops. We looked at project management systems. We looked at legal workflows in law firms. We

Lots and lots of wireframing and user tests. About 20 in fact, each between 30 - 90 mins. One of the probate team (Yaz) put in extra time to help out. Our probate lead (June) was so helpful. I was lucky to work with such an engaged team. Everyone was excited to help out!

Throughout, I had regular 1:1s with stakeholders, feedback sessions with the product team, and as a team we kept the company up-to-date in All Hands.

Through an iterative process, we began to arrive at a solution. I started mocking up in high fidelity.

I brought elements of the project to our design crit every week for about 2 months. They said they loved seeing it progress – I wonder if, really, they were sick of it… ;) Our crits are such a helpful way to unblock problems and nudge things forward.

We spun the project out into smaller builds. 


## Reflections
For all the user testing, you can’t replicate multiple real life cases
