> Empathy is Tom's superpower. It's really the basis of what makes him an amazing manager, facilitator and communicator.

## Design manager ## 

I'm a design manager at [Thriva](https://thriva.co/). I help to:

* Support my direct reports by caring genuinely, listening actively and through coaching, pairing and mentoring. I like the way that [Daniel Pink](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) puts it – that we're motivated by autonomy, mastery and purpose. 

* Support and grow a diverse design team, helping set up rituals, tools, practices and an equitable working environment.

* Support product leads and helping drive product impact by bringing a design perspective, building connections across teams and helping develop ways of working.

>I do feel like I can come and talk to Tom about anything, he provides a safe space to talk about thing openly and honestly. From my first week, he made sure to make time to speak to me about my mental and physical health issues and trying to think about ways he can help.

> Tom's always asking the right questions to get us moving forward. It seems that he has excellent working relationships with other parts of the business and always offers to go out and get the answers we need to enable us to move forward. 

> I've really appreciated when Tom has pushed me to be more tactical about how I work - by breaking down projects into tasks, setting time-bound goals, and being ruthless about scope. I always come out feeling so much more clear and motivated about what I'm working on.

## Product designer

Before transitioning to design management, I was a lead product designer. I'm still hands on from time to time. As a designer, I try to join the dots between complex problems and outcomes in a kind, open and deeply collaborative way.

> I’m frequently in awe at how Tom can take in what seems to be something incredibly complex or vague and loosely defined and produce out the other side a really clear and well understood model, diagram, design or kick-off doc
