### Problem

EcoOnline offers a suite of Health & Safety (‚ÄòH&S‚Äô) products. One of them ‚Äì our Risk Assessment module ‚Äì was dramatically underperforming.

Risk assessments are a foundation of health and safety. Although they're a legal requirement, only 23% of our customers used our Risk module. Customers wanted to see significant improvements so they could adopt the module and maximise the value of our full H&S suite.



### Project

*Risk Assessments, summer/autumn 2024.*

üìù **Brief:** Identify barriers to adoption make improvements to boost usage, satisfaction and sales.

üë© **Team** 

* Me ‚Äì Senior Product Designer. I led the discovery and design. 
* Pete ‚Äì Product Manager
* Maria ‚Äì User Researcher
* Chris ‚Äì Tech Lead.
* Working closely with our cross-functional product squad and around 16 stakeholders from our Engineering, Sales, Implementation and Solutions teams.
 
üöÄ **Key Results** 

* Increase user satisfaction ‚Äì improving the Product Experience Score from its baseline of 48%, the lowest across all Eco products.
* Increase sales by the end of 2025.

These KRs are supported by short-term proxy metrics, including reducing the time required to write a risk assessment.


### Understanding the problem

Pete and reviewed existing research and interviewed internal subject matter experts. One of them ‚Äì Rob ‚Äì described the Risk module as ‚Äúthe sleeping giant‚Äù.

John from Sales told us this:

<div class="feature-block" markdown="1">

> We‚Äôre embarrassed to sell the product ‚Äì we know if we demo the Risk module for more than 3 minutes we‚Äôll come across an extremely bad experience

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Äì *John, Sales Team*

I dug deep into the module's features, flows and usabilty pain points.

I collaborated closely with subject matter experts to produce ideal-path user journeys. They helped root us in the context of use and the needs of our user types ‚Äì an HSE manager, a member of an HSE team on site, and a frontline worker.

With the help of a business analyst Marko, Pete and I conducted a competitor analysis. 

I reviewed products across EcoOnline to understand different approaches to Risk ‚Äì for example, in chemical safety.

We spoke with experts in the UK, Nordics and USA to understand regional variations in risk assessment practices.

### Generative research

I worked with our user researcher Maria on a script and plan for a round of generative user interviews. 

Our goal was to dig deep into customers‚Äô experiences and unmet needs, to uncover problems and begin formulating opportunities. I hosted many of the calls.

![Still from an interview video](/images/risk-generative-interview.webp "Still from an interview video")

Throughout discovery, Pete and I kept stakeholders in the loop, shared updates, and encouraged collaboration.

We met with:
* A group of subject matter experts once a week
* Our tech leads and Eco‚Äôs solutions architect once a week
* A wider stakeholder group every 3 weeks

### Honing in on priorities

With the help of stakeholders, I laid out opportunities in an opportunity solution tree format. Pete and I honed in on priority areas which insights suggested would have the biggest user and business impact.

### Site visit

We're lucky to have clients who are very engaged with our process. It was very important to me to build close relationships with them. 

One of our clients invited us to one of their sites ‚Äì facilities management operations for a large office building and a hospital.

We met engineers, security and cleaning staff. We saw them go about their work and asked them about their challenges and experiences. One crucial insight: end users need deeply readable, simple risk assessments, as many face language barriers or struggle with dense text.

![Photo from a client site visit](/images/risk-site-visit-photo.webp "Photo from a client site visit")

The site visit was a highlight of my professional year ‚Äì it brought our work to life and helped us empathise with end users. I made a video for the team to help communicate our learnings.

### Sketching, flows and wireframes

I ran a sketching session with the team. Here‚Äôs a suggestion from Anita, a H&S expert. Aspects of the final solution can be traced back to her ideas. 

![Screenshot from a sketching session](/images/risk-sketching-session.webp "Screenshot from a sketching session")

I produced wireframes to test early ideas with customers. We wanted to know quickly if we were on the right lines. I worked transparently, involving stakeholders, developers and bringing these early ideas to design crit. 

We tested these concepts with around 7 customers.

![Wirefame](/images/risk-wireframe-testing.webp "Wirefame")

Here's an insight about viewing historic versions of a risk assessment:

<div class="feature-block" markdown="1">

> So let's say for example, we had an incident. What I would like to be able to do is demonstrate what had changed between those two assessments. So if we had an incident, I'd fallen over, broken my leg. We updated the assessment and then the next week, someone else fell over and broke the leg. And the HSE goes hang on a minute. You've had two people break their legs in one week. What did you update in that assessment?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Äì *Insight from a client*

</div>

With Maria‚Äôs help, I produced an affinity map ‚Äì groups of insights, quotes and ideas from the interviews, to spot patterns.

![Affinity map](/images/risk-affinity-mapping.webp "Affinity map")

As a result of our analysis, and after discussion with stakeholders, we de-prioritised one area (templating) and honed in on two others (viewing historic versions and UX).

### Flows and high fidelity designs

I mapped out flows for our two priority areas.

![Screenshot of user flows](/images/risk-flows.webp "Screenshot of user flows")

I began working on high fidelity designs, collaborating with the team and mapping them to the flows.

### A readable, usable, accessible experience

One strand of insights related to Step 2 of the module. We‚Äôd learned that it was:
* Hard to read
* Inefficient to edit
* Inaccessible in some respects 

Linking back to our desk research, Anita‚Äôs ideas in the sketching session, the interviews with customers and learnings from the site visit, I designed a radically new experience.

This is the old page:

![Screenshot from current live product](/images/risk-current-product-1.webp "Screenshot from current live product")

And these are my designs, just before the last round of usability testing:

![Hifi designs for testing](/images/risk-hifi-designs-for-testing-1.webp "Hifi designs for testing")

This is an expandable, editable table that aligns with users‚Äô mental models for risk assessments. It‚Äôs more visual and readable, with pictograms, colours, and no need to click in and out of sub-pages, making it a vastly more efficient experience both to edit and read.


### Prototype usability testing

We ran a round of moderated tests with around 6 customers, asking them to perform tasks using a high fidelity prototype. 

I invited developers from our squad to join our tests ‚Äì I‚Äôm delighted that there was a dev in every test. 

![Still from a moderated usability test](/images/risk-hifi-testing-blurred.webp "Still from a moderated usability test")

One important insight: it was crucial for clients to be able to configure column order, so the most important information is visible by default, allowing them to see key information at a glance. 

Here‚Äôs a clickthrough of the updated design, after testing.

### Delivery and Outcomes

We delivered high fidelity designs for our top 2 priority areas. 

Client feedback has been extremely positive. Here‚Äôs an audio clip:

> I love it. That is perfect. It's easy for me to say because I'm a health and safety professional, but this couldn't be any simpler for any person in our business to create an assessment and that's one of the key things ‚Äì we need it to be simple. That, to me ticks all the boxes. They've got the different steps, they've got the pictograms, they've got the colour. I like everything about it, it is just what I wanted to see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Äì *Feedback from a client*

</div>

I‚Äôm currently (Nov 2024) working with the engineers in our squad to deliver some quick wins which we‚Äôd identified during discovery, with a view to delivering the high impact priority areas in 2025.


### Reflections

In a group meeting during discovery, I shared early designs with stakeholders. One of them called me out for not being bold enough ‚Äì he wanted to see a radically different approach with much greater usability gains. He was right. It was the kind of direct feedback I needed, and I quickly went back to the designs and made improvements. I thanked him for his input.

We‚Äôre lucky to have very engaged clients. In interviews, a couple of them were angry that EcoOnline hadn‚Äôt made more progress with the Risk module in the months and years before I joined the business. It was important I listened, understood and involved them. User interviews in B2B SaaS can sometimes involve these elements of diplomacy and communication, not only gathering insights.
