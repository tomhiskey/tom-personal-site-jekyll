### Problem

Checklists are a vital Health & Safety (‚ÄòH&S‚Äô) tool. They‚Äôre used by H&S professionals for safety inspections and by frontline workers for checks before using machinery.

EcoOnline offers a checklist module, with intelligent reporting and analysis. However, only 20% of our customers were using it, with complaints about inefficient processes and poor UX.

We identified AI as a way to greatly streamline processes, and, longer term, drive adoption. 

Additionally, the marketing team saw this as an opportunity to showcase AI's potential. With increasing client interest and AI becoming a strategic priority for EcoOnline, the Checklist project allowed us to explore AI's benefits for users and business, and to test the water for our technical team. 



### Project

The AI Checklist Editor project, summer 2024 ‚Äì EcoOnline‚Äôs first AI product.

üöÄ **Goals:** decrease time to creating checklists by 50%; test our new AI service in a live product; learn about customers‚Äô reactions to AI. 

‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 10 weeks from kick-off to launch.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Team:**

* Me ‚Äì Senior Product Designer. I led the discovery and design.
* Peter ‚Äì Product Manager
* Working as part of a cross-functional product squad, partnering with engineering manager Chris and working with our developers and Maria, our researcher.

### Discovery

Because of timescales and goals of the project (plus, it was relatively low risk), we took a launch and learn approach, without problem discovery. But of course, we wanted to learn about users' needs, and how best to meet them with our designs.

Pete and I consulted internal subject matter experts about the use of checklists in H&S.

I dived into the current product with a UX teardown and maps of our current flows.

I hosted a sketching sessions with engineers and others. I find it a helpful way to get the team engaged and involved in the problem space, and to gather ideas for wireframing.

Here‚Äôs a sketch from Matt, our tech lead...

### The technical side

Our engineers had built a proof of concept for an AI-powered checklist editor. We worked with them closely, understanding its capabilities and limitations.

Behind the scenes, the new editor would be powered by an AI service being developed in parallel by our tech team. This service integrates with AI platforms like ChatGPT and Claude, wrapping user prompts in additional context and instructions, before formatting and displaying responses directly within the UI.

On the legal and privacy side, Pete worked closely with our Legal team and others to ensure compliance and clarity for our clients and their data.

### Flows and design iterations

I quickly produced rough wireframes for feedback from the team.

Collaboratively, we began to unpick how we wanted the system to behave and the scope for v1.

As an aid for the team I produced a user journey map. I hosted a session where together we reviewed and refined the flow, and discussed challenges and pain points.

I iterated on the designs, gathering feedback from the team and designers in design crit.

With Maria's help, I set up a quantitative usability study using UX Tweak. 

For one of the tasks we asked users to edit the heading ‚ÄòPre-operation checks‚Äô. The heat map analysis showed users making choices we hadn‚Äôt expected...

In the next version of the designs, I added a pencil icon to that header to more clearly indicate the editable region.

We also ran moderated user tests to gather more qualitative insights. As well as helpful constructive feedback, the response from clients was hugely positive.

## High fidelity designs

In this screen, the user enters their prompt:

And the AI produces this checklist:

Beyond the AI aspects, this editor was a greenfield project ‚Äì a totally new approach for EcoOnline. We're now using these designs in other aspects of the system, beyond the AI checklist editor. 

### Delivery

I worked very closely with our engineers throughout delivery. One of them ‚Äì Scott ‚Äì often called me out of the blue, and I was very grateful. In an office, it‚Äôs the equivalent of rolling your chair round and asking a question. Remotely, we naturally feel reluctant to do something similar. But when delivering at pace, the shorter the feedback loop between engineers and designers, the better.

We made trade-offs. I'd pushed for drag-and-drop functionality for re-ordering of the items. But after discussing the options and timescales with the engineers and Pete, we settled on using arrows to move rows one by one. It was a practical compromise to get the product over the line.

We launched in Sep 2024, piloting with a handful of clients. The pilot was successful and we rolled it out to all users a few weeks later.

Here's the checklist editor in production:

### Outcomes

The new AI checklist editor decreased the average time to create a checklist template from 25 minutes to 5 minutes. That‚Äôs an 80% decrease in time and an increase in efficiency of 420%, smashing our KR.

That includes time to review and amend the AI suggestions.

Creating a checklist was now a streamlined, efficient experience for users.

This was reflected in their feedback:

<div class="feature-block" markdown="1">

> That is brilliant, it is going to save me so much time!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Äì *Client feedback*

</div>

<div class="feature-block" markdown="1">

> Oh my this is like Christmas come early! Don‚Äôt tell anyone in my team ‚Äì I going to surprise them and say look how busy I have been over the weekend! Look at all these checklists I have made!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Äì *Client feedback*

</div>

The AI Checklist Editor has become a flagship example of AI and innovation at EcoOnline. It‚Äôs been prominently featured in client pitches and marketing efforts, and I‚Äôm thrilled to see the positive impact it‚Äôs having.

### Reflections

This was the first time I'd worked with AI ‚Äì it was fascinating and a lot of fun.

Early on, I encountered some resistance from people who felt we should just build the proof of concept without changes. I had to stand up for the value of design. In user-centered product development it's important not to be led by solutions, and to ensure we're designing with users in mind. I'm glad to say everyone seems delighted with the end result.

Reaction from clients has been overwhelmingly positive. But we learned that many remain wary about AI in other H&S contexts. Exploring ways for AI to enhance users' experience without sacricing safety, quality or compliance is a fascinating challenge.
